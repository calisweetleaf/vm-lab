# VM Lab Integration Run

I ran 26 checks against the public read-only CLI, internal daemon/registry/storage boundary, and guest bootstrap.
I observed 25 passes, 1 failures, and 0 skips.

## What I exercised

- `protocol_vm_primitives`: pass — round-tripped strict VM definition/ports, rejected coercion and unknown fields, preserved aliases, and proved cold import isolation
- `protocol_agent`: pass — round-tripped and adversarially validated 8 agent protocol surfaces
- `protocol_control`: pass — round-tripped and adversarially bounded 24 version/control/event protocol cases with a cold-import proof
- `protocol_settings`: pass — validated 9 strict typed-settings cases across legacy, split, generated-profile, root-ownership, and secret-reference paths
- `protocol_host_consumption`: pass — proved canonical VMRecord identity through compatibility imports and the real non-mutating planner/CLI; public plan output is versioned, secret-free, and leaves no host state or port reservation
- `protocol_vm_lifecycle`: pass — round-tripped every canonical VM schema; exhaustively enforced all lifecycle edges and typed evidence; rejected contradictory runtime observations, intent/history drift, process-identity substitution, nonconsecutive boot/process/observation replay, unsafe QMP paths, duplicate error causes, migration-provenance tampering, and unverified v0 states; proved immutable records, exact DECLARED migration, terminal destruction/new generation, idempotent operations, and cold import isolation
- `contract_roundtrip`: pass — round-tripped one canonical secret-free record, rejected an illegal state jump, and fixed guest endpoint names
- `configuration`: pass — loaded resolved configs and rejected truthy booleans plus ambiguous QMP paths
- `port_allocation`: pass — bind-checked 24 distinct ephemeral ports across eight threads
- `qemu_plan`: pass — encoded a comma-bearing disk path with JSON blockdev and a valid QMP path
- `bootstrap_extraction`: pass — extracted bounded data and rejected traversal, links, duplicates, and size drift
- `bootstrap_idempotency`: pass — installed/recovered bounded payloads and rejected stale, ambiguous, mislabeled, or colliding intent
- `doctor_truthfulness`: pass — reported 9 source-aware checks with healthy=False
- `cli_entrypoint`: pass — ran checkout-independent topology, redacted planning, and clean port-exhaustion errors
- `wheel_runtime`: fail — AssertionError: 
- `daemon_transport_p2`: pass — proved bounded SO_PEERCRED Unix transport and exclusive daemon ownership
- `registry_p2`: pass — proved normalized SQLite ownership, integrity, migration, and writer locking
- `registry_service_p2`: pass — proved strict metadata operations and abrupt writer-exit recovery
- `daemon_registry_p2`: pass — proved 24-process operation races and real SIGKILL recovery at every checkpoint
- `storage_p3`: pass — proved pinned-base import, two real 100 GiB overlays, and exact checkpoint recovery
- `storage_p3_adversarial`: pass — proved foreign-image non-adoption, checkpoint tamper rejection, and parent-death containment
- `daemon_storage_p3`: pass — proved real daemon/client storage composition and startup physical reconciliation
- `plan_contract`: pass — validated 405 unique execution IDs across phases P0-P18
- `plan_index`: pass — validated live plan index with 1881 direct observations
- `plan_index_rejections`: pass — rejected 8 hostile plan fixtures: duplicate-json-key, missing-dependency, dependency-cycle, missing-gate, multiple-current-phases, completed-without-evidence, owner-path-escape, duplicate-plan-id
- `source_manifest`: pass — verified 33/33 preserved source files against their byte hashes

## What was surprising

I intentionally accept an unhealthy doctor report on hosts without QEMU. The test passes when the doctor names those blockers accurately. QEMU launch, QMP identity, and public lifecycle mutation remain withheld until their physical gates pass.
