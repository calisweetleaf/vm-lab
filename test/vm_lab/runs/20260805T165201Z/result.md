# VM Lab Integration Run

I ran 15 checks against the promoted non-mutating boundary and guest bootstrap.
I observed 15 passes, 0 failures, and 0 skips.

## What I exercised

- `protocol_vm_primitives`: pass — round-tripped strict VM definition/ports, rejected coercion and unknown fields, preserved aliases, and proved cold import isolation
- `protocol_agent`: pass — round-tripped and adversarially validated 7 agent protocol surfaces
- `contract_roundtrip`: pass — round-tripped one record, rejected an illegal transition, and fixed endpoint names
- `configuration`: pass — loaded resolved configs and rejected truthy booleans plus ambiguous QMP paths
- `port_allocation`: pass — bind-checked 24 distinct ephemeral ports across eight threads
- `qemu_plan`: pass — encoded a comma-bearing disk path with JSON blockdev and a valid QMP path
- `bootstrap_extraction`: pass — extracted bounded data and rejected traversal, links, duplicates, and size drift
- `bootstrap_idempotency`: pass — installed/recovered bounded payloads and rejected stale, ambiguous, mislabeled, or colliding intent
- `doctor_truthfulness`: pass — reported 9 source-aware checks with healthy=False
- `cli_entrypoint`: pass — ran checkout-independent topology, redacted planning, and clean port-exhaustion errors
- `wheel_runtime`: pass — installed a wheel with checkout-free CLI and clean malformed-payload exit behavior
- `plan_contract`: pass — validated 405 unique execution IDs across phases P0-P18
- `plan_index`: pass — validated live plan index with 1733 direct observations
- `plan_index_rejections`: pass — rejected 8 hostile plan fixtures: duplicate-json-key, missing-dependency, dependency-cycle, missing-gate, multiple-current-phases, completed-without-evidence, owner-path-escape, duplicate-plan-id
- `source_manifest`: pass — verified 33/33 preserved source files against their byte hashes

## What was surprising

I intentionally accept an unhealthy doctor report on hosts without QEMU. The test passes when the doctor names those blockers accurately. Lifecycle mutation is withheld until a real-metal QMP gate exists.
